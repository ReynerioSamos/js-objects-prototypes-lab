There are 8 exercise.js files encompassing the following topics in Parts:
1) Part 1: Function Syntax - EX 1
2) Part 2: Arrow Functions - EX 2
3) Part 3: Object Literals - EX 3-4
4) Part 4: Object.create() and Prototypes - EX 5-7

With EX 8 being a practical application of all topics learnt.

Testing was done by loading the scripts into a .html file and launching via a browser (in this case Firefox)
